For this lesson, you will need an [Overleaf](overleaf.com) account.
A free one will have all of the features you need for the course.
Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor that is widely used.

You will also need the 
[`brawl_at_allen.txt`](/data/brawl_at_allen.txt),
[`troubadour.jpeg`](/data/troubadour.jpeg),
[`battle.jpeg`](/data/battle.jpeg),
and [`trial.jpeg`](/data/trial.jpeg) files,
which you can download from the hyperlinks embedded here.
These will be uploaded to Overleaf once we have created a project.
